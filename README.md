# Team: Cookie Breakers

Our implementation plan according to the downloaded notebooks:
1) **Encoding part**. Here we decided to get rid of hash data and exchange them by encoding ones in every table.
2) **Clustering part**. This part include forming new features for our data from __RFMV__ approach and applying clustering KMeans algo to the customer data with new one.
3) **Preparing to the model**. Before starting to train the model, it's not a simple way how data can be processed in order to be input for model. This part is devoted to this task.
4) **Training and testing model**. In this part we train and test our model, get metrics, such as __Precision@k__ and __Recall@k__ metrices.

**5) Notebook **MostPopularGoods.ipynb** contain extra calculus for business model.

For each part we prepared well-organized notebooks. Check them out!
